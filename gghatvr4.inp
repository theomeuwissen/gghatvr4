(*) 'filename' yields the genotype file (possibly incl. path).
# if Gmatrix is provided in gghatvr3.g file: filename="0"
#'filename' can include a '%'-sign which is replaced by the chromosome number to read the e.g. 'ldmip3.out' file of
# each chromosome. E.g. ldmip3.out% means that chromosome 2 data are read from ldmip3.out2. Or: chr%/ldmip3.out
# means that chromosme 2 data are read from ldmip3.out in directory chr2/
#
# Which format is used for reading the genotypes depends on the name of the genotype file:
#
# IF(fil_format == "ldmipmrk"):
# it's assumed to be a .mrk file: every animal has to lines: one for the 1st chromosome and one for the 2nd chromosome (although the alleles may be swapped; i.e.
# the genotypes	  do not need to be phased). column_1 contains an    animal_ID which	can also be recovered from the output files. column_2:(nloci+1) contains the nloci alleles
# of the chromosomes, coded 1, 2 or 0 (0=unknown).
#
#
# IF(fil_format == "ldmipout"):
# it's assumed to be a ldmip.out file. The formatting of the output of the ldmip program is assumed.
#
#
# IF(fil_format == "ldmipgen":  ##this is actually a quite general genotype file:
# it's assumed to be a genotype file, whose alleles will be renumbered. 
# The first line will be usually skipped as a header line, but incase a markermap is provided (see HELP3), it contains the (alphanumeric) marker_ids at columns 2:(nloci+1) [column1 is skipped]
# The format of the remaining lines is:
# idno A T G C 0 0 T T..... 
# idno=integer_ID_of_animal, the letters denode nucleotides, "0" denotes missing (2 per locus; 2*nloci per line) 
#
#IF(fil_format == "012":
#the genotypes are assumed coded 0, 1, 2, for homozygot, heterozygot, opposite homozygot (any number outside range 0-2 is considered as missing genotype)
#one line per animal: animal_id genot_1 genot_2 ..... genot_n
#
#IF(fil_format == "bgl":
# beagle output file with extension ".phased"
#
#IF(fil_format == "plinkbed":
# PLINK file with extension ".bed" (.bim file is not needed)
# if PLINK .fam file is present: its 2nd column will be read to obtain IDnumbers for the genotyped animals



#(**) the marker map file contains:
line1: header line 
In the remaining lines:
chromosome_no marker_id 
(the marker id agrees with those of columns 2:(nloci+1) of the header line of the .gen genotypefile)  
(note: the number or chromosomes at the first position of gghatvr3.inp is 1 (since all data come in one (chromosome) file)
